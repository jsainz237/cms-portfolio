# CMS Portfolio

### [jessesainz.com](https://jessesainz.com)

2025 Portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.io.

### Inspiration

A big feature I wanted with this version of my portfolio was a way to easily add and remove dynamic content. With constant updates to packages and libraries, even adding a simple 3 line code change to my old portfolio had to potential to take hours due to dependencies and node versions not being compatible.

After some research, I decided to use Sanity.io as my CMS provider. With it's content dashboard, I can easily add and edit my projects, tech, biography and more without any code changes.

### Design

I was heavily inspired by newspaper and magazine designs and wanted to tie that in with a modern, clean design. You can see some of my design flow in the mockups PDF below.
